<h1>The Otus programming language</h1>
The Otus programming language aims to be a *"simple but powerful"* alternative to C, 
and takes heavy inspiration from languages such as <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a>
 and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO">Jai</a>.
The current goal of the language is to be:

<ul>
	<li>**Clear and concise**, to remove unnecessary complexity</li>
	<li>**Powerful**, to ease the development of large and complex software</li>
	<li>**Lightweight**, to allow greater expressiveness without a loss of performance</li>
</ul>
