<h1>The Otus programming language</h1>
The Otus programming language aims to be a *"simple but powerful"* alternative to C, 
and takes heavy inspiration from languages such as !(odin, Odin)
 and !(jai, Jai).
The current goal of the language is to be:

<ul>
	<li>**Clear and concise**, to remove unnecessary complexity</li>
	<li>**Powerful**, to ease the development of large and complex software</li>
	<li>**Lightweight**, to allow greater expressiveness without a loss of performance</li>
</ul>
