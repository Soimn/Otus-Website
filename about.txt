<h1>The Otus programming language</h1>
The Otus programming language aims to be a *"simple but powerful"* alternative to C, and takes heavy inspiration from languages such as !(odin, Odin) and !(jai, Jai). The current goal of the language is to be:
<ul>
    <li>**Clear and concise**, to ease readability</li>
    <li>**Low friction**, to ease development of complex software</li>
    <li>**Minimalistic and extensible**, to allow arbitrary levels of abstractions</li>
</ul>
