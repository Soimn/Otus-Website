<h1>The Otus programming language</h1> The Otus programming language aims to be a <i>"simple, but powerful"</i> alternative to C, and takes heavy inspiration from languages such as <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO">Jai</a>. The current goal of the language is to be: <ul> <li><b>Clear and concise</b>, to remove unnecessary complexity</li> <li><b>Powerful</b>, to ease the development of large and complex software</li> <li><b>Lightweight</b>, to allow greater expressiveness without a loss of performance</li> </ul> </div>

Hi. I am Simon. A sometimes humble game and engine developer living in Norway, who apparently decided to stack mountains on top of each other to reach Mt. Olympus. The mountains being code and Olympus being an actual working compiler. Before recapping half a year of development, a bit of background. <br> <br> Around Christmas time last year, I grew a bit frustrated with C and C++. At the time I was working on my Nth iteration of a game engine, using a small subset of C++, and wanted to rewrite my MIN/MAX macros as proper functions to allow for type checking. Little did I know that the frustration of there being <u>no</u> implementation of MIN/MAX in C or C++ that I would satisfied with. I tried out different version of templated functions, which I despised, and eventually went on to scour for compiler specific C extensions. While searching I continuously chanted that "there must surely be a proper way to implement MIN/MAX functions in C". Eventually I stumbled upon "generic selection macros" in C. Compile time selection of expressions based on type seemed to be the solution I was looking for. However, there was still a slight problem with the approach. Apparently MSVC does not properly support any new (new being post 90's) features of the C language, making generic selection a no go. <br> <br> What I wanted from C, or C++, was the ability to write, or generate, a maximum of <u>three</u> functions (int, uint, float) and have the result cast to the correct common type. Now, this may seem like a negligible problem. Surely generating a small number of functions, or even using a C like naming scheme, would not harm the resulting program significantly. It was not this small scale issue I was troubled with, but rather the fact that the language prevented me from expressing what I wanted to do, without a lot of cruft. All the problems I had with C and C++, most of them being with C++, accumulated to critical mass right around the time I started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO">Jonathan Blow's</a> videos on his new language Jai. Jai seemed like a godsend at the time. I fondly remember working on the rendering API for my game engine while watching one of his compiler streams. When working on the rendering API I found myself wanting a way of "unpacking" structs. This would allow for standardizing common elements in structs, without needing to access the members via an intermediary variable. I was about to suggest this "struct unpacking" idea, when I realised that a superior version was already implemented in Jai (the using statement). It seemed however that Jai would release way of in the future, and I could not wait that long, so I decided to make my own language. <br> <br> The language started as an extension to C with added metaprogramming and altered casting rules. The syntax was similar to C, with some added quirks due to type inference, multiple return values and improved templates, and functioned almost exactly like C. This introduced some problems, as I had at that time never written a parser (or any other part of a compiler), and the many quirks of C syntax, including my own additions, seemed like too much. I therefore decided to alter the syntax a bit, changing it to look more like Jai. Along the way I also came up with some (I would say "interesting") ideas, and the syntax ended up being a hot mess. After several renditions due to aesthetics, holisticity and semantics, I arrived at a syntax similar to Jai, but different in a few subtle ways. <br> <br> I planned on using this language up until Jai released and then switch, but as the project grew I felt like I had arrived at a crossroads. One option would be to make a throwaway language and continue on engine development, another would be to pause the development of my existing projects and develop a proper language. This dilemma lead to a lot of frustration and hopelessness as I did not see myself being able to finish both the engine and the language in any reasonable time frame. However I did not like the idea of making a compiler for a throwaway language either. After working on a parser for the language I also found myself a bit repelled by the complexity of it. By extension I also found myself displeased with the complexity of Jai, as my language was supposed to be simpler version of it (so that I could manage the development it). At the same time I was watching a lot of language design talks, and stumbled upon <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a>. Odin seemed to have taken a similar route to my language, simplifying Jai. However, I still found Odin to be a little too complex, and after developing the parser in C, I found that I really did not need much to program effectively. I therefore decided to throw everything I did not deem necessary out the window, and strive to make the language as simple as possible. However simplifying the language too much could, strangely enough, lead to more complexity, as evident with machine language. I therefore adjusted my aim towards "simple but powerful", by reducing the moving parts of the language to a few powerful constructs that could be used directly or to build new abstractions. <br> <br> Lately I have been redesigning the language's syntax and semantics, as I found that a lot of the "unique" concepts I had introduced were not useful enough to outweigh the added complexity. One of those concepts was "infix function calling". This was a purely syntactical alternative to calling functions, allowing for operator-like functions with no semantic difference from a regular call. 
<div class="code">
// Normal function call
Inner(a, b);

// Infix call
a 'Inner' b;

// Prefix call
Length' a;

// Postfix call
a 'Length;
</div>
 This seemed like a good idea, since the language does not have operator overloading. It proved however to only be useful in very specific circumstances (like vector operations) that could be solved by a more useful construct. I have also been sketching out the specifics of metaprogramming in the language, and have learned, by a lot of trial and error, that an integral feature of the language, such as metaprogramming, should <u>not</u> be retrofitted to an existing language, but rather built in tandem with it. <br> <br> And that is most of the early development of this language summarized, with most of the frustration, cuss words, stupidity and details removed for ease of reading. The language is still far from finished, especially since I decided to scrap months of work, but it seems like this project is feasible, and would possibly prove to be useful to at least one person. </div>
